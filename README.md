## Motivation
My partner loves backgammon and we play often when we are together. There was a period of about 6 months during which I was away and I wanted a way for us to still play together even though we were apart. I was also looking for a project to sharpen my Python skills and maybe learn something new in the process. I know there are online options for playing backgammon that would have been quick and easy, however:

- why should we have to surrender our emails to yet another dubious website?
- I wanted a way to save our games and play them back - either to learn or for bragging rights.
- I wanted to be able to analyze our moves using a game engine.
- I wanted to be able to create custom gameboard designs.
